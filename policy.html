        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>
          Your privacy is very important to us. At
          <span class="highlight">ShoeMaster</span>, we have a few fundamental
          principles:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
          </li>
          <li>
            We don’t share your personal information except to comply with the
            law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
          </li>
          <li>
            We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required
            for the on-going operation of one of our services.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
        <p>
          Like most website operators,
          <span class="highlight">ShoeMaster</span> collects
          non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers
          and servers typically make available, such as the browser type,
          language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each
          visitor request. Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
          information is to better understand how our visitors use our website.
        </p>

        <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
        <p>
          Certain visitors to <span class="highlight">ShoeMaster</span>’s
          websites choose to interact with us in ways that require us to gather
          personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information
          that we gather depends on the nature of the interaction. For example,
          we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at ShoeMaster.com to provide a
          username and email address.
        </p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
          The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but
          remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method
          of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use
          commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we
          cannot guarantee its absolute security.
        </p>

        <h2>Advertisements</h2>
        <p>
          Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising
          partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to
          recognize your computer each time they send you an online
          advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your
          computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things,
          deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most
          interest to you.
        </p>

        <h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
        <p>
          Although most changes are likely to be minor,
          <span class="highlight">ShoeMaster</span> may change its Privacy
          Policy from time to time, and in ShoeMaster’s sole discretion. We
          encourage visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to
          its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change
          in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
